## üíª Tech Stack

This dashboard is built using a combination of powerful and modern technologies to provide a seamless and interactive experience:

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for all backend logic, data processing, and AI integration.
* **Streamlit:** An open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. It's used to build the interactive web application with a simple Python script, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment.
* **Pandas:** A fundamental data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It's used for efficient CSV parsing, data cleaning (e.g., date conversion, handling missing values, column normalization), and data aggregation.
* **Plotly:** A powerful graphing library that allows for creating interactive, publication-quality graphs. It's integrated with Streamlit to render dynamic and responsive data visualizations.
* **OpenAI SDK:** The official Python library for interacting with OpenAI-compatible APIs. It's used here to send requests to the OpenRouter.ai platform for AI model inference.
* **OpenRouter.ai:** A unified API for various large language models. It serves as the platform through which the application accesses different AI models for generating insights and recommendations.
* **HTML/CSS (via Streamlit Markdown):** Custom CSS, inspired by Apple's design principles, is injected into the Streamlit application using Markdown to achieve the clean, modern user interface.
